# Datasets for catalogs OCR and segmentation 

## Description

This repository is composed of several datasets which contain images and transcriptions of historical catalogs. 
These datasets are used to train new models of segmentation and OCR. 
Segmented zones in the ALTO data presented here are following [SegmOnto guidelines](https://github.com/SegmOnto/Guidelines). 

`PictoCatalogs` : composed of pictorialist exhibitions catalogs. 
`Groupe Annuaires et Adresses` : composed of a directory
`IMAGO`: composed of art exhibition catalogs. 
`Katabase`: composed of manuscript sales catalogs. 
`ODD`: composed of french novels. 

The `Groupe Annuaires et Adresses`, `IMAGO`, `Katabase` and `ODD` datasets are based on the [repository developed by Juliette Janes](https://github.com/Juliettejns/cataloguesSegmentationOCR/). 
The segmented data provided by Juliette Janes has been updated by Frédérine Pradier to match the current [SegmOnto](https://github.com/SegmOnto) naming zone ontology. 

This repository is under construction.
