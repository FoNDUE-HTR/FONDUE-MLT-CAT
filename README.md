## Description

![characters badge](badges/characters.svg) ![regions badge](badges/regions.svg) ![lines badge](badges/lines.svg) ![files badge](badges/files.svg)


This repository is composed of several datasets from different research projects. These datasets contain images and transcriptions of historical catalogs (19th and 20th c. prints) and are used to train new models of segmentation and OCR. 
Segmented zones in the ALTO data presented here are following [SegmOnto guidelines](https://github.com/SegmOnto/Guidelines). 

- `PictoCatalogs` : composed of pictorialist exhibitions catalogs (Photo-Club de Paris).
- `Expositions Universelles`: composed of World's Fairs catalogs. 
- `Groupe Annuaires et Adresses` : composed of a directory. 
- `IMAGO`: composed of art exhibition catalogs. 
- `Katabase`: composed of manuscript sales catalogs. 
- `ODD`: composed of french novels. 

The `Groupe Annuaires et Adresses`, `IMAGO`, `Katabase` and `ODD` datasets are based on the [repository developed by Juliette Janes](https://github.com/Juliettejns/cataloguesSegmentationOCR/). 
The segmented data provided by Juliette Janes has been updated by Frédérine Pradier to match the current [SegmOnto](https://github.com/SegmOnto) controlled vocabulary. 

This repository is under construction.
